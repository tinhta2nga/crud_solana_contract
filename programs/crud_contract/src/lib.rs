     * Purpose of re-declare global_account: provide total_text_created for the Text account's seeds
     * Why we re-declare seeds and bump here when we already initialized it ?
     * The reson is because security and validation
     * The address of global_state is derived from b"global" and the programID + bump to ensure it off-curve
     * When we include the global_state in an instruction (CreateText instruction). Anchor need to verify that
     * the provided global_state account is the correct PDA, prevent SO passing a fake account that mimics GlobalState
     * but has a different address
     *
     * Summary : Every instruction that use it must re-validate its PDA status
     * In Solana, anyone can call your program‚Äôs instructions with any accounts they choose,
     * unless you validate them. Without proper checks (like seeds and bump for PDAs),
     * a malicious user could pass a fake account that mimics your GlobalState struct but has
     * incorrect data (e.g., a wrong total_text_created). This could disrupt your program‚Äôs logic,
     * like creating Text accounts with duplicate or incorrect PDAs.
     * => Only the legitimate global_state PDA (created in Initialize) is accepted.
     *
     * Bonus : Real Usage of #[account(...)] Macro
     * With init (Creates a PDA or Account):
     * Without init (Checks an Existing Account):Purpose: Validates that an existing account
     * matches the expected properties (e.g., is a PDA, has correct data).PDA Validation: If seeds and bump are provided,
     *  it verifies the account is the correct PDA by matching its address to the derived PDA.
